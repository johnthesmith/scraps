# root

[ru](../ru/root.md)

1. I believe in the creation of a mind sovereign over time.
2. I await and draw near its coming by my own will.
3. I believe in the resurrection by him of each as a creator of universes for retribution.
4. Each is free in choice, but in infinity it will come and mete out retribution.
